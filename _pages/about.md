My name is Sebastien Derhy, I am originally from Paris, but live in Tel-Aviv since July 2014. I've always been passionate about the intersection between technology (in particular deep learning and computer vision), research, and business. This is one of the reasons creating this blog was so important to me. 

I am currently Lead Applied Scientist at [Datagen](http://datagen.tech/), a startup helping computer vision scientists work seamlessly in a data-centric R&D cycle using synthetic data.

My past experiences include:

* Navigation Intelligence Team Leader at [Via Transportation](http://ridewithvia.com/)
* Algorithm Team Leader at [Samsung Israel Research Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsung-israel-r-d-center-sirc/)
* COO & Co-founder of [Fitterli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUsOPtzlLtc), a startup that aimed at leveraging depth cameras in smartphones for online shopping
* VC at [Elaia Partners](https://www.elaia.com/), one of the leading European VCs, first investors of several French unicorns: Criteo (NASDAQ: , CRTO), Shift Technology, and Mirakl. 
* Visiting Researcher at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), where I worked at the GIP lab under the supervision of [Ron Kimmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Kimmel) on a [Gesture-based Tetris game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsIQsUALLf4).  


I hold an MSc in Applied Mathematics from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) and an MSc in Entrepreneurship from [HEC](https://www.hec.edu/en).
