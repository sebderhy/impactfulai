# Let’s make AI count as it should.

Over the last 10 years, I’ve realized that applied research (and more specifically AI) is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can help you solve incredibly complex problems, and create an insane Return-On-Investment for companies. But on the other hand, according to a [Venturebeat article](https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/16/the-future-of-ai-deployments-reaching-production-is-bright-in-2021/) (based on a Gartner report), only  20% of AI projects ever get deployed to production, and among those, only 40% are profitable! Unfortunately, these figures do not surprise me, as I’ve seen countless algorithmic and machine learning projects fail in my career. 

I created this blog in order to analyze the reasons behind such failures, share experiences (mine and others’), and generate discussions that could eventually help maximize the impact of AI research in the real world.
