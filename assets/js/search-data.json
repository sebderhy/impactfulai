            "title": "Why This Blog",
            "content": "Over the last 10 years, I’ve realized that applied research (and more specifically AI) is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can help you solve incredibly complex problems, and create an insane Return-On-Investment for companies. But on the other hand, according to a Venturebeat article (based on a Gartner report), only 20% of AI projects ever get deployed to production, and among those, only 40% are profitable! Unfortunately, these figures do not surprise me, as I’ve seen countless algorithmic and machine learning projects fail in my career. . I created this blog in order to analyze the reasons behind such failures, share experiences (mine and others’), and generate discussions that could eventually help maximize the impact of AI research in the real world. . Learning from the Startup World . In this blog, I will often tackle the questions raised above with an innovative angle: adapt lessons from the startup world to the AI conceptual world. Indeed, although we often hear about how startups can leverage AI to improve their business, no one to my knowledge took the opposite angle and explored how to leverage the widely studied and experienced startup world to improve AI’s impact on the world. . This idea may sound very weird at first sight, but anyone who looks closely at those two systems will be stricken by their similarities: a high risk of failure, an uncertain environment, the need for agility and speed, the urge to convince many stakeholders and align their interests, the necessity to find harmony between tech and business, … . Last but not least, the similarities between those 2 worlds particularly resonate with me, since I have been a VC investor and founder in the past, invested myself in a few startups, and generally spend a lot of time discussing and working with entrepreneurs. . Who is this blog for? . At a high level, this blog is for people that - like me - believe that AI’s impact should be much larger than it is today. More specifically, I think 3 types of people can learn from this blog: . Applied researchers like myself, who love reading papers and solving hard technical problems, but who are more motivated by their actual impact than their salary or implementing the latest cool AI paper (who said GAN ;-)?). . | Entrepreneurs and leaders, technical or not, on questions such as: “what to look for when recruiting?”, “what kind of ML infrastructure will make my teams most effective?”, “When to know when to stop an AI project”, etc… . | Investors or future entrepreneurs, on questions like “what are the problems in the world of AI today”, “who is tackling them and how”, etc… . | . Terminology . There are many close terminologies in the world of AI, and you will notice that I often use terms such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Algorithms, Applied Research in an interchangeable manner… Some people may tell you that they are very different (I personally don’t think so), and there are many debates about differences between those fields. However, the truth is that in our case, the terminology doesn’t make such a difference, because they all relate to the same problem: how to handle risky projects that can have a huge impact, but whose results are quite unpredictable, and can often also very easily fail. Again, you can see here why I believe startups can teach us a lot on those projects. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
