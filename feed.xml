Even though there is some truth to these catchphrases (after all, we data scientists/AI scientists do spend most of our time on the data), the vast majority of academic AI papers still revolve around new approaches that improve x% on famous dataset benchmarks such as ImageNet. Even in the industry, most data scientists often get their data as a given constraint for the problem they need to solve, and not as a variable they can optimize to better solve their task at hand.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Risk Management</title><link href="https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/12/06/Risk-Management.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Risk Management" /><published>2021-12-06T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-12-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/12/06/Risk-Management</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fall In Love With The Problem, Not The Solution</title><link href="https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/11/01/Fall-in-love-with-the-problem,-not-the-solution.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fall In Love With The Problem, Not The Solution" /><published>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/11/01/Fall-in-love-with-the-problem,-not-the-solution</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why This Blog</title><link href="https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/10/22/Why-This-Blog.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why This Blog" /><published>2021-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-10-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://sebderhy.github.io/impactfulai/2021/10/22/Why-This-Blog</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Over the last 10 years, I’ve realized that applied research (and more specifically AI) is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can help you solve incredibly complex problems, and create an insane Return-On-Investment for companies. But on the other hand, according to a Venturebeat article (based on a Gartner report), only 20% of AI projects ever get deployed to production, and among those, only 40% are profitable! Unfortunately, these figures do not surprise me, as I’ve seen countless algorithmic and machine learning projects fail in my career.</summary></entry></feed>
